# Maschine Kit Duplicator
This is a utility script designed to collate all the wav files present in Maschine Expansion Kits.

Using this script preserves the Expansion-Kit structure of the source wav files.


## Motivation behind this script
I was looking for an easy way to collate all my Maschine expansions outside of Maschine/Battery ecosystem and use the sounds inside FL Studio (with the Channel Rack).



## Usage
* Install python 3.8 on your system
* Open command line/ terminal and navigate to this project's directory
* Run command `python3 mkd.py`
* Follow the on-screen instructions

### Note
In case an expansion kit's output directory already exists, this utility will skip processing that particular kit
